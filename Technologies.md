# Explanation of Technologies for Production 

## Git 

Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Git allows companies to track changes of a project file over time. This allows large teams to work efficiently and collaboratively where each developer can work on their own version of the project. Once it comes time to put each person's portion of the project together they can merge and adapt their version of the project to the main version without destroying anyone else's work. 

## Docker 

Docker allows developers to share projects and run them in a similar format to each other. This is similar to a virtual machine and gets rid of any discrepancies between the two different computer environments. In a production environment, Docker makes it easy to create, deploy, and run applications inside of containers. Containers let developers gather applications and all their core necessities and dependencies into a single package that you can turn into a Docker image and replicate. Docker images are built from Dockerfiles. The Dockerfile is a file where you define what the image will look like, what base operating system it will have, and which commands will run inside of it. Essentially, companies and developers utilize Docker containers because it is a dramatic improvement for cloud development, and DevOps in general. 

## Automated testing 

This is a way to debug code by running your program through a large set of test scenarios and conditions. Automated testing is the application of tools and technology to testing software with the goal of reducing testing efforts, delivering capability faster and more affordably. It helps in building better quality software with less effort.

## Continuous Integration 

This is similar to git in that it allows a team to individually work on the same project and integrate each of their contributions all at once. Each team member can work on the project on their branch without having to wait to get the most updated version of the project. Their code is then merged to a single working branch. This ensures that everyone's code is working properly and is well-tested. In conclusion, continuous integration is basically when you automatically test every single commit/push.
