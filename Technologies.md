# Explanation of Technologies for Production 

## Git 

Git Allows companies to track changes of a project file over time. This allows large teams to work efficiently and collaboratively where each developer can work on their own version of the project. Once it comes time to put each person's portion of the project together they can merge and adapt their version of the project to the main version without destroying anyone else's work.

## Docker 

Docker allows developers to share projects and run them in a similar format to each other. This is similar to a virtual machine and gets rid of any discrepancies between the two different computer environments.

## Automated testing 

This is a way to debug code by running your program through a large set of test scenarios and conditions. Automated testing is the application of tools and technology to testing software with the goal of reducing testing efforts, delivering capability faster and more affordably. It helps in building better quality software with less effort.

## Continuous Integration 

This is similar to git in that it allows a team to individually work on the same project and integrate each of their contributions all at once. Each team member can work on the project on their branch without having to wait to get the most updated version of the project. Their code is then merged to a single working branch. This ensures that everyone's code is working properly and is well-tested. In conclusion, continuous integration is basically when you automatically test every single commit/push.
